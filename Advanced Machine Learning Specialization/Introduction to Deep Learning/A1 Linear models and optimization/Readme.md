In this programming assignment I have to implement a linear classifier and train it using stochastic gradient descent modifications. All parts of classifier is implemented from scratch, like converting data into polinomial, softmax and crossentropy loss function. Also we're asked to make experiment with different optimization techniques, like SGD with minibatch, Momentum, RMSprop.

Data: Hypothitical Data
Method: Linear Classifier
